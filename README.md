# Titanic Dataset README

## Overview
The Titanic dataset is a widely recognized benchmark dataset for machine learning and data analysis. It is based on the passenger data of the Titanic shipwreck and serves as an excellent case study for predictive modeling, particularly in classification problems. The primary goal is to predict passenger survival outcomes based on various attributes.

This dataset is part of the Kaggle Titanic Competition, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced data scientists to practice feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model building.

## Dataset Files
The dataset comprises the following files:

1. **train.csv**
   - Training dataset used for model development.
   - Includes passenger information and survival outcomes.

2. **test.csv**
   - Testing dataset used for predictions.
   - Does not include survival outcomes (target variable).

3. **gender_submission.csv**
   - Example submission file demonstrating the required format for competition submissions.

## Dataset Features
Both `train.csv` and `test.csv` share the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes). Available only in `train.csv`.
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger in years.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Loading the Data
Use the following code snippet to load the dataset:
```python
import pandas as pd

train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
```

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset. Typical steps include:
- Visualizing survival rates by categories (e.g., gender, class).
- Checking for missing values and anomalies.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Prepare the data for model training:
- Handle missing values (e.g., impute missing ages, drop irrelevant columns).
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for `Sex` and `Embarked`).
- Scale numerical features (e.g., standardize `Fare`).

### 3. Feature Engineering
Extract meaningful features, such as:
- Family size: Combine `SibSp` and `Parch`.
- Title extraction: Parse titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs.) from names.
- Fare bins or age groups for categorical analysis.

### 4. Model Development
Build and evaluate classification models using frameworks like `scikit-learn`. Common models include:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

### 5. Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

### 6. Submission
Generate predictions for `test.csv` and save them as `submission.csv` in the required format.

## Example Code
Below is a sample pipeline for predicting survival:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load and preprocess data
train_data['Age'].fillna(train_data['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
train_data['Embarked'].fillna(train_data['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
train_data = pd.get_dummies(train_data, columns=['Sex', 'Embarked'], drop_first=True)

# Feature selection
X = train_data.drop(['Survived', 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1)
y = train_data['Survived']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
val_predictions = model.predict(X_val)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_val, val_predictions):.2f}")

# Test predictions and submission
X_test = pd.get_dummies(test_data, columns=['Sex', 'Embarked'], drop_first=True)
X_test = X_test.reindex(columns=X.columns, fill_value=0)
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'PassengerId': test_data['PassengerId'],
    'Survived': model.predict(X_test)
})
submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
```

## Best Practices
- Use cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
- Tune hyperparameters using tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna.
- Experiment with different features and models to improve predictions.
